# Cloud Notify GitHub Action Documentation

Receive push notifications on your iOS device via this GitHub action to notify you of the progress of your builds.
This runs sequentially, as a result, place the below code anywhere in your workflow where you'd like to get notified of an particular event.
A popular example of this would be to place the code below at the end of your Workflow file do you can get notified upon build completion.
You can also use this to get notified of any errors in your build throughout your workflow (which will require you to place this code more than once around the workflow).

You will need our app installed on the deivce you want to receive notifications on.

- iOS: On the App Store next week
- Android: Currently in development

## Pre-requisites

To run this action you'll need:

- An API token from the app.
- An USERID key, also from the app.

## Setup

1. Inside one of your GitHub projects in an existing workflow create an event.
2. Name and bring in the action code into your worflow file (.yml file):

```
- name: Cloud Notify push notification
  uses: nathan1258/cloudNotify-action@master
```

3. Add a new secret `CLOUD_NOTIFY_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUD_NOTIFY_USERID_KEY` (both found in the app) inside your repo's settings.
4. Commit your update .yml file.

## Example Workflows

### You can send a notification on every commit

```yaml
name: Notify on every commit

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Cloud Notify push notification
        uses: nathan1258/cloudNotify-action@master
        env:
          TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUD_NOTIFY_API_TOKEN }}
          USERID: ${{ secrets.CLOUD_NOTIFY_USERID_KEY }}
          TITLE: `New GitHub commit on ${process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY} ðŸŽ‰`
          MESSAGE: "There is a new commit!"
```

### Or, simply use this section of code anywhere in the workflow file to update you on particular steps.

The code below was pasted at the bottom of a workflow file to notify me when the build completes

```yaml
- name: Build finished notification
        uses: nathan1258/cloudNotify-action@master
        env:
          TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUD_NOTIFY_API_TOKEN }}
          USERID: ${{ secrets.CLOUD_NOTIFY_USERID_KEY }}
          TITLE: "BUILD HAS FINISHED ðŸŽ‰"
          MESSAGE: "THE BUILD HAS FINISHED"
```

## TODO

### - Add Link support enabling the user to be directed to a specified link on tap of notification

### - More developer tools in one app

### - Android support
